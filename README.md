# 404's LifeHacks
I present: Various things I have learned over time!

## Linux
This section contains apps that have been helpful in my linux endeavours!

### [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/)
tmux is a terminal multiplexer

If you are currently using screen, you should really consider switching to tmux as using it is like night and day.

yum/apt-get install:
```
sudo yum install tmux
or
sudo apt-get install tmux
```

## Windows
Windows is a special kind of special and has it's own special tools!

### [ATOM.IO](https://atom.io/)
A hackable text editor for the 21st Century

I have used a lot of different text editors, including the much respected notepad++, and this is by far my favorite editor for writing code in.

Plugins:
- [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap) - a minimap that acts as a "you are here" sign
- [todo-show](https://atom.io/packages/todo-show) - a quick place to find all of your reminders
- [pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments) - displays actual colors inline with your code/css
- Linters (code validation):
 - [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) - base package (required)
 - [linter-jshint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-jshint)
 - [linter-htmlhint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-htmlhint)
 - [linter-csslint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-csslint)
- [highlight-selected](https://atom.io/packages/highlight-selected) - shows all instances of your selection

### [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
Notepad++ is a free source code editor and Notepad replacement

Notepad++ is probably the most powerful editor you can get for free on Windows. However, I would strongly try Atom for new projects.
